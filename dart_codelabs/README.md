All labs are from https://dart.dev/codelabs

The lab instructions assume use of Dartpad, the online combination editor/REPL.
I'll do it instead in VS Code using the Dart plugin.

If you're interested in running Dart code from the command line,
then you'll need to install the Dart SDK,
which comes with a stand-alone Dart VM enabling this functionality.
