Even better, read this:

Problem with article's 3rd approach (findAncestor...()) is it doesn't know when
the state changes. It also requires a named state variable, which makes
the stateless widget NOT immutable, and is not suggested for other reasons
(i.e. it makes you add logic to createState(), which is frowned upon)

Solution: Use a InheritedWidget.
Drawback: InheritedWidget's are super low-level.

Solution: 
	Pub Dev 'provider' package acts as an extension of InheritedWidget
	to "make them easier to use and more reusable".

	The Flutter team even highly recommends using it, to the point that it's
	even in their 'getting started' guides.
